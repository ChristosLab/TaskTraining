function TrainAntiSaccadeLab2(varargin)
%  Changes to code
%  04-01-05, Changed frame1-frame4 to one variable frametime(1-4). TM
%  04-11-05, Changed AllData structure to save trials as a vector. TM
%  04-15-05, Added code to allow the use of either the old class structure,
%   without frametime, or the new class structure.
%  08-18-05, Adding Target and saccade sections.
%  10-26-05, moved gateofftime to begining of trial loop (before flushingAllCoordinates
%  ai), made subWrong a constant 1, and moved FixOff to right after the
%  last TTL pulse at the end of the trial, TM
%  Sep-09-08, add 'SizeofStim' to control stimulus size.
%  May-1-11, XQ, AntiSaccade task
% fix->cue->delay->saccade to opposite location of cue
% prefrences: ClassAntiSaccade
% green fixation
% Statecode == 4 | Statecode == 5 % 2 types errors
% 17-JUN-2019 cc Modified for training in lab 2

% use protocol named "ClassAntiSaccadeCircle" mat file
% save behavior file for overlap to make sure after several weeks
% training, monkeys behavior are stable, then recording can start

% Reaction time = TargetIn - CueOff?
